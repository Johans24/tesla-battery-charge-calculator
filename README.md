## Considerations

Regarding the wheel size functionality, what i implemented was an increase of size of the current wheel asset, however, i think
this would look much better with a different wheel asset. I also included an increase of the animation time, since that's kinda how
it looks in the reactivity example gif.

I'm really looking forward to discuss my implementations, and get some technical feedback!
